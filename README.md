### Project Description
Gossip AI Aunty

### The Problem:
People often seek comfort or advice, but most AI assistants respond too formally; there’s no playful, culturally relatable companion that blends humour, gossip, and personality.

### The Solution 
AmmayiGPT brings the charm of a Malayali neighbourhood aunty into an AI assistant, delivering conversations filled with sass, gossip, and passive-aggressive concern, creating a fun and culturally relatable chat experience.
